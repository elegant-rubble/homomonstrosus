    <h2>Soul etc.</h2>
    
		<p>Started a journaling practice/project/process. Trying to train myself to take everything to page (and screen). Or take it out on the page. Or take the page out to dinner, get it a little drunk and then grill it for its secrets.</p>

		<p>Doing a deep dive into the Hermit card, across many different decks. Sitting at the feet of my guides; or maybe taking them out to dinner, getting them a little drunk and then grilling them for secrets.</p>

		<p>Reading more, writing more, thinking more, and dealing with all the associated problems of such a fool-hearty lifestyle.</p>

		<p>No but seriously, it's all going quite well.</p>

		<h2>Violence etc.</h2>

		<p>Carving a path through the God of War series. Finished <em>God of War</em> (PS2) and started <em>God of War 2</em>. Amazing how a game can be both so ahead of its time and so dated at the same time. Not a problem for me though, I am thoroughly enjoying them and eager to see how the series evolves and transforms by the time it gets to the PS4 and beyond...</p>

		<p>Also playing a lot of <em>Mario Golf</em>s (N64 and GBC) to balance things out a bit.</p>

		<h2>Cake etc.</h2>

		<p>My birthday is soon and also I hear rumors that spring might be coming back as well. At this point this is all unverified chatter and probably not worth the cold, bitter breeze it blew in on. But we shall see...</p>

        <p><strong>Current Conditions: </strong>Spring should be arriving soon, but dang if winter isn't hanging on...</p>
